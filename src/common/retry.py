"""
Retry with exponential backoff and jitter.

Built in from the start because counterfactual replay multiplies the call
count: one flagged source on one event is one extra call, and docs/04 asks
for three repeats of every comparison across roughly 30 runs per scenario.
Free-tier Gemini rate limits will be hit, and a run that dies at event 40 of
60 wastes the whole run's tokens.

Deliberately transport-agnostic: the caller decides what is retryable and
raises Retryable, so this module has no HTTP knowledge and can be tested with
plain functions.
