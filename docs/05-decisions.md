# 05 — Decisions

Running log. Append, never rewrite. Every entry: what we chose, what we
rejected, why. In week 4 the paper's method section gets written from this
file, and you will not remember the reasons otherwise.

Format:

```
## D-004  LLM API and model
Date: 26-08-2026
Decided by: all three
Choice: Gemini API for all agents in the testbed.
Reason: available to us at low cost. Model tier TBD.
```

---

## D-001  Scope: full pipeline, shallow depth, one deep result
Date: TODO
Decided by: all three
Choice: build every component thin and connected end to end; evaluate the
exposure-vs-influence claim deeply.
Rejected: cutting to a single component; building every component deeply.
Reason: a system paper needs the whole pipeline to exist, but one month
cannot support depth everywhere. One measured claim is enough for
acceptance.

---

## D-002  Terminology: "small safe recovery set", not "minimum"
Date: TODO
Decided by: all three
Choice: avoid claiming minimality anywhere in code, docs, or paper.
Rejected: "minimum recovery set".
Reason: minimality is not provable when influence edges are estimates.
Claim only what is measured.

---

## D-003  Definition of "recovery succeeded"
Date: TODO
Decided by: TODO
Choice: TODO — decide in week 1, do not defer
Rejected: exact output matching
Reason: replay is non-deterministic; identical state is not achievable.
Candidates to pick from: (a) task-level success on a checkable outcome,
(b) semantic equivalence judged by an LLM with a fixed rubric, (c) both,
reporting agreement between them.

---

## D-004  LLM API and model
Date: TODO
Decided by: TODO
Choice: TODO
Reason: TODO — note budget, since counterfactual replay multiplies cost.

---

## D-005  Target conference and deadline
Date: TODO
Decided by: TODO
Choice: TODO
Reason: TODO — page count decides how much evaluation is required.

---

## D-006  Shared data models frozen
Date: TODO
Decided by: all three
Choice: `src/common/` models agreed in week 1, then changed only by
agreement of all three.
Reason: all three subsystems depend on them; a mid-project change breaks
everyone at once and burns days.
