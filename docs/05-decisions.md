# 05 — Decisions

Running log. Append, never rewrite. Every entry: what we chose, what we
rejected, why. In week 4 the paper's method section gets written from this
file, and you will not remember the reasons otherwise.

Format:

```
## D-004  LLM API and model
Date: 26-08-2026
Decided by: all three
Choice: Gemini API for all agents in the testbed.
Reason: available to us at low cost. Model tier TBD.
```

---

## D-001  Scope: full pipeline, shallow depth, one deep result
Date: TODO
Decided by: all three
Choice: build every component thin and connected end to end; evaluate the
exposure-vs-influence claim deeply.
Rejected: cutting to a single component; building every component deeply.
Reason: a system paper needs the whole pipeline to exist, but one month
cannot support depth everywhere. One measured claim is enough for
acceptance.

---

## D-002  Terminology: "small safe recovery set", not "minimum"
Date: TODO
Decided by: all three
Choice: avoid claiming minimality anywhere in code, docs, or paper.
Rejected: "minimum recovery set".
Reason: minimality is not provable when influence edges are estimates.
Claim only what is measured.

---

## D-003  Definition of "recovery succeeded"
Date: TODO
Decided by: TODO
Choice: TODO — decide in week 1, do not defer
Rejected: exact output matching
Reason: replay is non-deterministic; identical state is not achievable.
Candidates to pick from: (a) task-level success on a checkable outcome,
(b) semantic equivalence judged by an LLM with a fixed rubric, (c) both,
reporting agreement between them.

---

## D-004  LLM API and model
Date: TODO
Decided by: TODO
Choice: TODO
Reason: TODO — note budget, since counterfactual replay multiplies cost.

---

## D-005  Target conference and deadline
Date: TODO
Decided by: TODO
Choice: TODO
Reason: TODO — page count decides how much evaluation is required.

---

## D-006  Shared data models frozen
Date: TODO
Decided by: all three
Choice: `src/common/` models agreed in week 1, then changed only by
agreement of all three.
Reason: all three subsystems depend on them; a mid-project change breaks
everyone at once and burns days.

<!-- append new decisions below -->

## D-007  Automatic parent links are same-agent only
Date: 26-08-2026
Decided by: proposed with the trace layer, needs group sign-off
Choice: `TraceLogger.log_event(parents=None)` links the new event to the
previous event logged by the same agent. Cross-agent links (Planner ->
Researcher) must be passed explicitly; `parents=[]` marks a root event.
Rejected: linking to the previous event overall (whichever agent produced it).
Reason: chronological adjacency is not derivation. Auto-linking across
agents would manufacture edges that look like data flow, and contamination
that propagates along a manufactured edge is exactly the baseline error we
claim to avoid. Guessing wrongly here would flatter the baseline and could
also hide a real edge.

---

## D-008  Trace file format: one JSONL file per run, tagged records
Date: 26-08-2026
Decided by: proposed with the trace layer, needs group sign-off
Choice: one `.jsonl` per run under `data/runs/`. Each line is a JSON object
tagged with `"record"`: `meta`, `source`, `event`, or `influence`. Lines are
flushed as written.
Rejected: separate files per record type; a single JSON document written at
the end; SQLite.
Reason: append-only means a crashed or attacked run still leaves a readable
trace, and one file per run keeps a run self-contained for `data/runs/`
hygiene (docs/04). Both graphs rebuild from this one file. Revisit only if
trace size becomes a measured problem (open issue #8).

---

## D-009  Source content is stored inline; event content is stored by reference
Date: 26-08-2026
Decided by: proposed with the trace layer, needs group sign-off
Choice: `Source.content` holds the text. `Event.inputs_ref` / `output_ref`
hold opaque content-store keys, not text.
Rejected: inlining event content too; referencing source content too.
Reason: matches the storage policy in docs/02 — source content is always
needed for counterfactual replay, event content is only needed at
checkpoints. The content store itself is not built yet; refs are opaque
strings until it is.

---

## D-010  No content store yet; refs stay opaque
Date: 26-08-2026
Decided by: all three
Choice: `Event.inputs_ref` and `Event.output_ref` stay opaque strings. No
content store is built until selective replay actually needs event content.
Rejected: building the content store in week 1 alongside the trace layer.
Reason: nothing in weeks 1-2 reads event content. The graphs are built from
metadata, and counterfactual replay reads `Source.content`, which is stored
inline (D-009). Building a store now would be guessing at the interface
replay wants. The field names are already in the frozen schema, so adding
the store later does not change the models.
Consequence: `data/runs/*.jsonl` is not yet enough to replay a run. It is
enough to rebuild both graphs, which is the week-1 exit test.

---

## D-011  Exposure is a field on Event, recorded at logging time
Date: 26-08-2026
Decided by: all three
Choice: `Event.exposures` holds the source ids present in the agent's
context for that operation. Written by whoever runs the agent, at the moment
the call is made.
Rejected: a separate exposure record; deriving exposure inside
`src/provenance/` after the run.
Reason: exposure is an observation about the prompt, not an analysis result,
and it cannot be reconstructed once the run is over. It also is not a
provenance detail -- the exposure/influence gap *is* the paper's claim, so it
belongs in the trace next to the operation it describes. Keeping it on Event
means a trace file alone contains both sets, and figure 2 (exposure graph vs
influence graph, docs/04) can be drawn from one file.
